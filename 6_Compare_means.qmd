<!-- COMMENT NOT SHOW IN ANY OUTPUT: Code chunk below sets overall defaults for .qmd file; these inlcude showing output by default and looking for files relative to .Rpoj file, not .qmd file, which makes putting filesin different folders easier  -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = rprojroot::find_rstudio_root_file())
```

Remember you should

-   add code chunks by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar
    or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I* to answer the questions!
-   use visual mode or **render** your file to produce a version that
    you can see!
-   **render** your file to make sure it runs (and that you haven't been
    working out of order)
-   save your work often
    -   **commit** it via git!
    -   **push** updates to github

## Overview

This practice reviews the [Compare means among groups
lecture](https://jsgosnell.github.io/cuny_biostats_book/content/chapters/Compare_means_among_populations.html).

## Examples

We will run ANOVA's using the *lm* function to connect them to other
test. First, build the model

```{r}
iris_anova <- lm(Sepal.Length~Species, iris)
```

Then use the object it created to test assumptions

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(iris_anova)
```

If assumptions are met, check the p-value using the *summary* or *Anova*
function.

```{r}
summary(iris_anova)
library(car)
Anova(iris_anova, type = "III")
```

If the overall test is significant, carry out post hoc tests (Tukey
shown here for all pairs, as most common)

```{r}
library(multcomp)
compare_cont_tukey <- glht(iris_anova, linfct = mcp(Species = "Tukey"))
summary(compare_cont_tukey)
```

If assumptions are not met, we can use the Kruskal Wallis non-parametric
test and associated post hoc tests.

```{r}
kruskal.test(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
pairwise.wilcox.test(iris$Sepal.Length, 
                          iris$Species, 
                          p.adjust.method="holm")
```

or a bootstrap alternative

```{r}
library(WRS2)
t1waybt(Sepal.Length~Species, iris)
bootstrap_post_hoc <- mcppb20(Sepal.Length~Species, iris)
p.adjust(as.numeric(bootstrap_post_hoc$comp[,6]), "holm")
```

For 2 groups, the *boot.t.test* function in the **MKinfer** package is
also an option.

## Just for practice

### 1

Use the iris dataset in R to determine if petal length differs among
species. *Do this problems using ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, and
bootstrapping methods. Make sure you can plot the data and carry out
multiple comparison methods as needed. Also be sure to understand the
use of coefficients and adjusted R^2^ values and where to find them.*

### 2

Data on plant heights (in cm) for plants grown with a new and old
formulation of fertilizer can be found at

<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSUVowOKlmTic4ekL7LSbwDcqrsDSXv5K_c4Qyfcvz1lLE1_iINmGzy0zMGxY7z5DImlUErK4S2wY7Y/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=csv>.

Analyze this data using the t.test function and the lm function to
convince yourself that t-tests are special cases of ANOVAs, which are
special cases of linear models!

## For the following questions, pick the appropriate method for analyzing the question. Use a plot of the data and/or model analysis to justify your decision. Make sure you can carry out multiple comparison methods as needed. Also be sure to understand the use of coefficients and adjusted R^2^ values and where to find them.

### 3

Data on sugar cane yield for multiple fields is available using

read.table("<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRjstKreIM6UknyKFQCtw2_Q6itY9iOAVWO1hUNZkBFL8mwVssvTevqgzV22YDKCUeJq0HBDrsBrf5O/pub?gid=971470377&single=true&output=tsv>",
header = T, stringsAsFactors = T)

More info on the data can be found at
<http://www.statsci.org/data/oz/cane.html>. Is there evidence that
location (DistrictPosition column) impacts yield (Tonn.Hect column)? If
so, which areas are driving this distance?

### 4

Data on FEV (forced expiratory volume), a measure of lung function, can
be found at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.txt>

More information on the dataset is available at

<http://www.statsci.org/data/general/fev.html>.

Is there evidence that FEV depends on gender? If so, which gender has
the higher FEV score? How much variance does gender explain?

### 5

The following data are human blood clotting times (in minutes) of
individuals given one of two different drugs.

| Drug B | Drug G |
|:------:|:------:|
|  8.8   |  9.9   |
|  8.4   |  9.0   |
|  7.9   |  11.1  |
|  8.7   |  9.6   |
|  9.1   |  8.7   |
|  9.6   |  10.4  |
|        |  9.5   |

Test the hypothesis that the mean clotting times are equal for the two
groups

-   Estimating the variance from the data
-   Using rank transform analysis
-   Using a permutation test
-   Using a bootstrap test

### 6

(Example from Handbook on Biological Statistics) Odd (stunted, short,
new) feathers were compared in color to typical feathers in Northern
Flickers (*Colaptes auratus*) [@wiebe2002] . Data is at

<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsgosnell/CUNY-BioStats/master/datasets/wiebe_2002_example.csv>

Test the hypothesis that odd and typical feathers did not differ using

-   a Student's t test and/or lm
-   a rank test
-   bootstrapping

Note we will return to this question next week!
