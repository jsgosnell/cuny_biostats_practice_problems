These problems are part of a book that is meant to accompany biostatistics courses I teach at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate Center, but it may offer another perspective to anyone trying to learn statistics, R, or some combination. 
The course material now includes

a website housing slides and associated material
this was the original “home” for the material, and it is being updated to point here
tutorials for many lessons using Swirl
this book

## How do make sure you understand this stuff?

Using these skills and applying concepts correctly to interpret data sets may seem easy when you read about them or listen during class, but practice is key to ensuring you understand the material. 
Practice problems are provided for each lesson. You can make a copy (technically a fork, since you can’t directly edit it) of the entire website in github (@ https://github.com/jsgosnell/cuny_biostats_book and work from there. The benefit is this allows you to see updates to the site (if you sync your fork). The downside is you have to work interactively or build the entire site when you render a changed file. This is doable but may take more time than students need. Alternatively, you can download just the practice problems @ https://github.com/jsgosnell/cuny_biostats_practice_problems.

Solutions are also provided for all problems via the course notes, but try them before you look at the answers!
