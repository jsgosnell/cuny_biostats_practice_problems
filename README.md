These problems are part of a book that is meant to accompany
biostatistics courses I teach at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate
Center, but it may offer another perspective to anyone trying to learn
statistics, R, or some combination. The course material now includes a

    notes/book](https://jsgosnell.github.io/cuny_biostats_book/){target="_blank"}

-   a
    [website](https://sites.google.com/view/biostats/home){target="_blank"}
    housing slides and associated material

```

    updated to point

-   tutorials for many lessons using [Swirl](content/swirl_lessons.qmd)

-   these practice problems (which exist for ease in rendering - read
    below)

## How do make sure you understand this stuff?

Using these skills and applying concepts correctly to interpret data
sets may seem easy when you read about them or listen during class, but
practice is key to ensuring you understand the material. Practice
problems are provided for each lesson in the course book. You *can* make
a copy (technically a fork, since you canâ€™t directly edit it) of the
entire website in github \@
<https://github.com/jsgosnell/cuny_biostats_book> and work from there.
The benefit is this allows you to see updates to the site (if you sync
your fork). The downside is you have to work interactively or build the
entire site when you render a changed file. This is doable but may take
more time than students need. Alternatively, you can download just the
practice problems here. Your instructor may also provide alternative
problems or use a different delivery method (like github classroom).

**In general you should only work edit .qmd files! Everything/anything
else is produced during the session and should not be edited. All files
can be uploaded to github though.**

Solutions are also provided for all problems via the course notes, but
try them before you look at the answers!
